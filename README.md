***Project Overview:***
With this project, I aimed to create a fun and interactive "Memory Game" app for iOS devices.

***Goal:***
The goal was to provide users with an engaging gaming experience that challenges their memory and concentration skills.

***Impact:***
The final release of the app impacted hundreds of users, providing them with hours of entertainment and mental stimulation.

***Key Features:***
Users can choose between player-vs-player (PvP) and player-vs-CPU (PvC) modes.
I've implemented a smart CPU player for PvC mode to offer a challenging single-player experience.

***Future Development:***
Further enhancements may include additional game modes, customizable difficulty levels, and multiple different game themes.

**UPDATE:**
Added two more game themes: 1. Jungle theme 2. Ice-creams theme
